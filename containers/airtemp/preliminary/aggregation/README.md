## Air Temperature Aggregation Containers

These containers handle the processes of aggregating, mapping, and quality-controlling air temperature data, which is originally collected by the [data acquisition containers](containers/shared/acquisition).

Contents:
* [`base`](containers/airtemp/aggregation/base): Essential libraries, scripts, and directory setup.
* [`daily`](containers/airtemp/aggregation/daily): Daily aggregation and mapping.
* [`monthly`](containers/airtemp/aggregation/monthly): Monthly aggregation and mapping.
